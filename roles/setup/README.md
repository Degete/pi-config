# PI Setup

## Format

SD card can be formatted either using the playbook (old) or software such as [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/).

If using the software, after installing the OS generate a `ssh` file on the root path to enable ssh on the first boot.

Now you can boot the pi, you will be able to access with the default credentials:

- User: ubuntu
- Password: ubuntu
